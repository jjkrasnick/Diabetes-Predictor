# Diabetes-Predictor

I developed an end-to-end pipeline that predicts whether an individual is at risk of acquiring diabetes using various industry languages such as Python, R, and SQL.

First, I collected and preprocessed a large dataset consisting of medical history, lifestyle, and demographic information. Then, I used feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information, such as blood glucose levels and BMI, to use in the model.

I created machine learning models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms. These models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques, resulting in a highly accurate system with an AUC score of 0.85.

I utilized cloud computing services such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform to ensure scalability and efficient processing of the large dataset. I also implemented real-time data processing using tools like Kafka and Spark Streaming to enable timely detection and prevention of diabetes risk.

Additionally, I designed a user-friendly web application that allows users to input their medical history and lifestyle information and receive a risk prediction for acquiring diabetes. The application used industry languages such as Python, HTML, and JavaScript.

Overall, this project demonstrated my data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning, cloud computing, and web development expertise. It has the potential to help healthcare providers and individuals identify and mitigate the risk of diabetes, leading to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
